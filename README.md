# FoodTruckProject
Hello and welcome to my 2nd Skill Distillery Project! You can start the program and will be prompted to enter some information about a Food Truck. During the name question feel free to enter "quit" in order to skip the info input and go to the menu.
While inside the menu you will have several choices to get more out of the information you entered. 
* 1. Will display all Food Trucks and there corresponding information.
* 2. Will display the average of all the Food Truck's ratings.
* 3. Will select the best Food Truck based on its rating and display all of its information.
* 4. Will exit the program!
